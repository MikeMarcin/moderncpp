# Wisdom from Bjarne
New features allow people to write incomprehensible code!!! \
So do old powerful features.


* Keep simple things simple
* Don't make complex things unnecessarily complex
* Don't make things impossible

C++ is expert friendly \
C++ is not *just* expert friendly


# Use signed integer types
